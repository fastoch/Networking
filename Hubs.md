A hub is a **Layer 1 device** in the OSI model.  
You would use a Cat5 UTP cable with an RJ45 connector to connect a device to a hub.  

>[!note]
>UTP = Unshielded Twisted Pair

Hubs have been superseded by switches.  
However, it's important you understand how a hub operates because **wireless operates in the same way**.  
When you connect to a wireless network, you'll often encounter the same issues that you would when connecting to a hub.
