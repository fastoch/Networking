Switches are very similar to bridges, as they both reside at layer 2 (data link) of the OSI model.  

The big advantage of switching when compared to bridging is that **processing can be done in hardware**, using what are  
called **ASICs** or Application Specific Integrated Circuits.  
The number of ports supported by switches is also a lot higher.  

Switches can move traffic from one port to another at the same speed as if they weren't there.  
They can process and switch frames from one port to another without slowing the frame down.
