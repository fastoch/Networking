# VLAN Trunk Links

Using VLANs is like breaking a physical switch into a few virtual ones.  
But eventually we'll need more physical ports, which means more physical switches.  

**How do get our VLANs to work across several switches?**  
Like the many branches on a tree trunk, we can use a **trunk** link to carry many VLANs.  

If the company we work for grows, then they're going to need more computers, printers, servers, and other devices.  
Which means we have to buy more switches.  

Normally, we would connect one switch to another to extend our number of ports.  
But we have cut our network into VLANs now. So how do we connect the two switches together?  

Should we run a link between our switches for each VLAN?
We could, but what happens if we have many VLANs? We would be out of ports pretty quickly.
