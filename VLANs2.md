## What is a VLAN?

A virtual LAN is a single broadcast domain. It's also a virtual subnet or logical network.  
You could say it's a group of hosts with a common set of requirements attached to the same broadcast domain,  
regardless of where they are physically located.  
You are able to group multiple devices together logically rather than physically.  

It is possible to span a subnet (or VLAN) across multiple switches.
