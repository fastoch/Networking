# Duplex and speed mismatch

Duplex and speed mismatches occur when autonegotiation fails, or when manual configurations are mismatched.  
Autonegotiation may fail because of physical problems in the network such as cabling problems or a hub somewhere in the network.

Duplex mismatches do cause performance issues. Pings may succeed, but the movement of large files can be seriously affected.  
UDP in particular may have problems with recovering from duplex mismatch issues.  

Originally, Ethernet was half-duplex because devices were connected to hubs.
