When a PC is connecting to a web server, traffic will be sent from a source IP address to a destination IP address.  
When the traffic arrives at the server, the server needs a way to "decide" which application to send this traffic to.  

**Well-known port numbers** are used for various common day applications, like HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443).  

The sender will use a random port number in a specific range, depending on the OS.
