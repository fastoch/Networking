## Introduction to Network Devices

The OSI reference model was developed to help disaparate devices communicate on networks.  
**OSI** stands for Open Systems Interconnection.  
Devices may be classified by the level of the OSI model at which they operate. 

### Layer 1 devices

The analog **modem** modulates a digital signal into an analog signal and demodulates the return signal to allow  
for network communication.  

The **hub** receives a network signal on a port and replicates that signal out of all the remaining ports.  

### Layer 2 devices 

The **switch** utilizes an ASIC chip to learn which devices are connected to which ports via the device's MAC address.  
When the switch receives network traffic, it will only forward that traffic to the specified MAC address.  
**ASIC** stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit.  

The **WAP** (Wireless Access Point) is used to bridge wireless network segments with wired network segments. 

### Layer 3 devices

The **Multi-Layer Switch** (MLS) operates at more than just the layer 2 of the OSI model.  
The most common MLS is the Layer 3 switch. The ASIC chip is programmed to handle more than just MAC addresses.  

The **router** is the most common device used to connect different networks together.  
It utilizes software programming to learn about routes between networks.

### Security Devices

#### Firewall

A firewall can be placed on routers or hosts (software-based) or can be its own device (appliance).  
It functions at multiple layers of the OSI model: layers 2, 3, 4 and 7.  

It blocks packets from entering or leaving the network via:
- stateless inspection
- stateful inspection

**Stateless inspection:**  
The firewall will examine every packet against a set of rules.  
When a packet matches a rule, the rule is enforced, and the specified action is taken.  

**Stateful inspection**:  
The firewall will only examine the state of the connection between networks.  
Specifically, when a connection is made from an internal network to an external network, the firewall will not examine  
any packets returning from the external connection.  
As a general rule, external connections are not allowed to be initiated with the internal network.  

Firewalls are the first line of defense in protecting the internal network from outside threats.

#### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An IDS is a passive system designed to identify when a network breach or attack against the network is occurring.  
It's usually designed to inform a network administrator when a breach or attack has occurred through log files, SMS, or  
email notifications.

An IDS cannot prevent or stop a breach or attack on its own.  
It receives a copy of all traffic and evaluates it against a set of standards.  
Those standards can be:
- signature-based: evaluates network traffic for known malwares or attack signatures
- anomaly-based: evaluates network traffic for suspicious changes
- policy-based: evaluates network traffic against a specific declared security policy

An IDS can be deployed at the host level. We talk about an "Host-based IDS" or "**HIDS**".
