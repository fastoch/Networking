## Introduction to Network Devices

The OSI reference model was developed to help disaparate devices communicate on networks.  
**OSI** stands for Open Systems Interconnection.  
Devices may be classified by the level of the OSI model at which they operate. 

### Layer 1 devices

The analog **modem** modulates a digital signal into an analog signal and demodulates the return signal to allow  
for network communication.  

The **hub** receives a network signal on a port and replicates that signal out of all the remaining ports.  

### Layer 2 devices 

The **switch** utilizes an ASIC chip to learn which devices are connected to which ports via the device's MAC address.  
When the switch receives network traffic, it will only forward that traffic to the specified MAC address.  
**ASIC** stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit.  

The **WAP** (Wireless Access Point) is used to bridge wireless network segments with wired network segments. 

### Layer 3 devices

The **Multi-Layer Switch** (MLS) operates at more than just the layer 2 of the OSI model.  
The most common MLS is the Layer 3 switch. The ASIC chip is programmed to handle more than just MAC addresses.  

The **router** is the most common device used to connect different networks together.  
It utilizes software programming to learn about routes between networks.
