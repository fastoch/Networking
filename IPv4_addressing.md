Address Classes or Classful Networks were used in the Internet from **1981** until the introduction of  
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (**CIDR**) in **1993**.  

Class A, B and C were used for Unicast traffic (one destination).  
Class D was used for Multicast traffic (several destinations).  
Class E was reserved for future or experimental purposes.  

IPv6 does not use address classes.  

Classes A, B and C were used to accomodate different sizes of networks.  
- Class A range: from 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
- Class B range: from 

**IANA** = Internet Assigned Numbers Authority  

An IPv4 address is made of 4 octets (or bytes), which equals 4 x 8 bits.
