## Address Classes

Address Classes or Classful Networks were used in the Internet from **1981** until the introduction of  
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (**CIDR**) in **1993**.

**IANA** = Internet Assigned Numbers Authority is a standards organization that oversees:
- global IP address allocation,
- autonomous system number allocation,
- root zone management in the Domain Name System,
- media types,
- and other Internet Protocolâ€“related symbols and Internet numbers.

Class A, B and C were used for **Unicast** traffic (one-to-one communication).  
Class D was used for **Multicast** traffic (talking to a group of devices).  
Class E was reserved for future or experimental purposes.  

>[!note]
>IPv6 does not use address classes.  

Classes A, B and C were used to accomodate different sizes of networks.  
- Class A range: from 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 
- Class B range: from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
- Class C range: from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
- Class D range: from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (Multicast)
- Class E range: from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (reserved addresses)

An IPv4 address is made of 4 octets (or bytes), which equals 4 x 8 bits.  
- In a class A address, the first 8 bits denote the network portion, and the last 24 bits denote the host portion.
- In a class B address, the first 16 bits denote the network portion, and the last 16 bits denote the host portion.
- In a class C address, the first 24 bits denote the network portion, and the last 8 bits denote the host portion.

## Special Addresses

### Directed Broadcast Address 
used to send data to all devices on a specific network.  
The **host portion** of the address is populated with binary ones.  
Example: 172.31.255.255  

Routers can be configured to route directed broadcast. But this is disabled by default.  
For security reasons, it's recommended that the forwarding of directed broadcast be disabled.
Nowadays, routers and switches drop directed broadcast traffic to prevent denial of service attacks.  

### Local Broadcast Address
used to communicate with all devices on the local network.  
The entire address is populated with binary ones: 255.255.255.255  
This address is used, for example, by a host when requesting an IP address from a DHCP server.
