# Understanding ACLs

Sometimes we need to control or influence traffic that flows through our network.  
Maybe we want to restrict access to some sensitive resources, or maybe we want to limit  
the amount of non-business traffic to conserve bandwidth. In either case, we need to use  
Access Control Lists, also known as ACLs.
