## From Cat1 to Cat8  

**Higher Category** means:
- more twists
- less susceptible to electromagnetic interference
- more stringent specifications for cross talk and system noise

---

### Obsolete categories

Cat1 was used for telephones and modems. Not suitable for data transmission.  
Cat2 was used for telephones and data networks up to 4Mbps.  
Cat3 was used for networks up to 10Mbps. **Now generally used for telephones.**  

Cat4 - frequencies up to 20MHz with speeds up to 16Mbps.  
Cat5 - frequencies up to 100MHz with speeds going from 10Mbps to 1Gbps.  
Cat5e improves the Cat5 specification by reducing noise and signal interference.

### Most suitable categories for modern networks

**Cat6 - frequencies up to 250MHz with speeds up to 10Gbps (55m).**  
**Cat6a - frequencies up to 500MHz with speeds up to 10Gbps (100m).**  
**Cat7 - frequencies up to 600MHz with speeds up to 10Gbps (100m).**  
**Cat7a - frequencies up to 1GHz with speeds up to 100Gbps.**

### Next-gen of twisted pair cabling specification
Cat8 supports speeds up to 40Gbps.
- Cat8.1 - backward compatible and interoperable with Cat6a
- Cat8.2 - interoperable with Cat7

## DAC

Another copper cable you may come across is a **Direct Attachment Cable**.  
This cable comes in various lengths, up to 15 meters.  
It uses copper twinax and has **SFPs on each end**.  

A SFP or **Small Form-factor Pluggable** is a hot pluggable transceiver that can support various media types  
such as fiber or copper. This replaces GBICs or GigaBit Interface Converters.  

A DAC is inserted into an SFP+ slot and allows for a 10Gbps connection between 2 devices.  
Other SFPs or SFP+s will support fiber that can go to greater length.

## Rollover cable

A special cable used to connect to the consoles of networking devices.

It allows you to connect from the serial port of your computer to the console of a router or switch.  
Modern laptops don't have a serial port, you need to use a usb-to-serial port converter.
