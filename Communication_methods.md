## Unicast
One device speaks to another device. It's a one-to-one communication.

## Broadcast
One device sends traffic to all devices in the same subnet.  
In a lot of real-world implementations, broadcasts are limited and blocked by Layer 3 devices.  
In an IPv6 network, broadcasts are not supported.

## Multicast
A single device speaks to many devices.  
Multicast gets rid of some of the issues related to broadcast.  
Broadcast sends traffic to people that don't necessarily want the traffic.  
Whereas with the multicast, only the devices that subscribe to the multicast receive it.  
Devices have to explicitly ask for multicast traffic before they receive it.

A broadcast is like a spammer which is sending mail to everyone, including people who don't want it.  
A multicast, on the other hand, is like an opt-in or subscription service to a mailing list.
