From Cat1 to Cat8  

**Higher Category** means:
- more twists
- less susceptible to electromagnetic interference
- more stringent specifications for cross talk and system noise

---

Cat1 was used for telephones and modems. Not suitable for data transmission.  
Cat2 was used for telephones and data networks up to 4Mbps.  
Cat3 was used for networks up to 10Mbps. **Now generally used for telephones.**  

Cat4 - frequencies up to 20MHz with speeds up to 16Mbps.  
Cat5 - frequencies up to 100MHz with speeds going from 10Mbps to 1Gbps.  
Cat5e improves the Cat5 specification by reducing noise and signal interference.

## Most suitable categories for modern networks:
**Cat6 - frequencies up to 250MHz with speeds up to 10Gbps (55m).**  
**Cat6a - frequencies up to 500MHz with speeds up to 10Gbps (100m).**  
**Cat7 - frequencies up to 600MHz with speeds up to 10Gbps (100m).**  
**Cat7a - frequencies up to 1GHz with speeds up to 100Gbps.**

## Next-gen of twisted pair cabling specification
Cat8 supports speeds up to 40Gbps.
- Cat8.1 - backward compatible and interoperable with Cat6a
- Cat8.2 - interoperable with Cat7
