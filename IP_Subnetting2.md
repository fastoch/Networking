# Subnetting - Packet Tracer - Lab 2

In a previous lab, 192.168.1.0/24 was broken up to support 4 subnets.  
Now you need to subnet the network to extend and conserve IP addresses.  
1. Break up subnet 2 192.168.1.64/26 to support as many subnets as possible with 8 hosts per subnet
2. Allocate the first new subnet to site 3 (new site)
3. Manually configure all devices in the subnet as follows:
* Router with last IP address in the subnet
* Switch with the 2nd last IP address
* Hosts from 1st IP address
4. Subnet the last new subnet you got from 192.168.1.64/26 with /30 masks
5. Then allocate the /30 subnets to the serial links (the links between the 3 routers and the Internet router)
6. Configure the routers appropriately
